# Photo-project-generator

Quickly generate photo project folders for offloading

### Usage

Open a command prompt/terminal in your main folder for the project and type 'ppg' to run the script. It will ask a few questions about the shoot, what cameras you used and what day of the shoot you are offloading, this will then create the folders for you in a neat, organized way.

### Installation

###### Linux/Mac

Install the correct binary into /usr/local/bin/ and rename it to simply `ppg`

###### Windows

Install the binary into your Windows directory
